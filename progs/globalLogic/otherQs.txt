1) will a class having copy constructor have default constructor? - No, if we define a copy constructor, the no default constructor
   is provided by compiler
2) when do we need a copy constructor of our own?

3) char *ptr = "hello"; //where is stored in memory? 

Ans: it's stored in the readonly section of the stack memory as it's auto variable.

practice programs

1) Reverse a string without using a temporary string - >done
2) Reverse the words of sentence - > done
3) swap two bits of an integer 
4) print the permutations
5) For a given array, find the max i-j, such that array[j] > array[i] - done
6) Rotate an array to the left by n number of indices - > done
7) Count decodings of digits - > done
8) You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

9) Sum of targets - done
10) Remove duplicate from a sorted array - done
11) Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
